## Do you have any questions of your own?

For the plan #2 of creating a mobile app. I use to know how to use React Native. Not sure if I can accomplish that and can use Appsheet/HoneyCode to try and do the same thing. If not I need help to create a time grid scroll with that app as a component. The goal with the app would be to work with a group and simulate devops enviroment as well as produce a workable prototype. The project has potential to become long term and can benefit as part of portfolio work.
