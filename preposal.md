# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Open-Source Field Work Order App using React-Native, AirTable, AppSheet, or Amazon Honeycode.

  - Create a universal work order app to use in the open-source market
  - Practice the process of DevOps and simulate a working enviroment.
  - Perform research about similar products and how this app can solve problems that other services cannot.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

- Michele Connors (for universal workorder idea) <br/>
- Isiah Thomas (for universal workorder idea) <br/> MIA
- yeptiz (for universal workorder idea) <br/> MIA

## Do you have any questions of your own?

For the plan #2 of creating a mobile app. I use to know how to use React Native. Not sure if I can accomplish that and can use Appsheet/HoneyCode to try and do the same thing. If not I need help to create a time grid scroll with that app as a component. The goal with the app would be to work with a group and simulate devops enviroment as well as produce a workable prototype. The project has potential to become long term and can benefit as part of portfolio work.
