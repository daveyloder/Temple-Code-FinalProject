Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

David - Developer / Project Coordinator

- Delagated task to team to handle resposibilities of project.
- Using AppSheet platform, was able to create the app's UI, database with data types, created actions based on user and stage of process, and created user and admin roles to better delagate the flow of how the app works.

Michelle - Lead Research

- Gave input on features that would be benificial to include into the app.
- Worked with David, and Isaiah to develop flow for the app. This includes how a work-order is created, assigned, completed, and if issue, how it gets resolved.
- Researched services like AppSheet and compared them to AppSheet to reinforce our decision to use the platform

Isaiah - Q&A Coordinator / Research

- Gave input on features that would be benificial to include into the app. This was based off real world scenarios in working roles such as Amazon, UPS, or FedEx when using propriatery apps.
- Assisted Michelle with research with services like AppSheet and comparison to similar services.
- Lightly tested the app as a user to see if there are any issues in regards to the app's UI, work-order creation, and completion.
- Report issues on github using work-order ID and the reason why the work order was an issue, that way David can explore the issue and make corrections.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

David

- Document all actions and other objects and items on AppSheet. This allows for easy interpretation when reading Application's Documentation which is located on the project's github.
- Write instructions on how to use the app for both admin roles, and user roles.

Michelle

- Write report on AppSheet, and what benefits of an open-source work order app can offer being on the open market. This can talk about why as a group we chose to use a platform such as AppSheet, why the app idea was created, and future support the app may have if continued outside of this class.

Isaiah

- Run heavy QA test of app from user role. This is just to test the app in multiple scenarios where a mobile device may have difference strength cellular connections or if multiple updates are being sent asyncronusly. If any issues, will be reported to github under issues section with work-order ID and issue.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

David

- Ran into issues with assigning multiple task to a work order during creation. This was because of how the app references other items on another database. This is an issue that is just with AppSheet and it's platform and if future support is continued it will be changed if migrated to a different framework or source-code.
- Issues with UI landing back on completed order after order was completed. Was not able to figure out why until finding that in AppSheet there is a feature to redirect user to a different screen view after form submition.

Michelle

- Difficult researching the different companies creating similiar apps. Most apps researched were for individual buisness models so it was hard finding apps that had universal tasks similiar to ours.
